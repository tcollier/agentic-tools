### agentic-tools-cqw: Improve BEADS.md output format

- Show dependency information (blocks/blocked-by relationships)
- Group issues by label or type in addition to status
- Add issue age/staleness indicators
- Include link to full issue details (if applicable)
- Better formatting for multi-line descriptions (code blocks, lists)
- Add table of contents for easy navigation
- Show issue count per status in section headers
- Format dates in human-readable relative time (e.g., '2 days ago')

The goal is to make BEADS.md more informative and easier to scan while maintaining readability for non-technical stakeholders.

### agentic-tools-q8w: Create Claude command for unique vibe coding interview questions

**Priority**: P2 | **Type**: null

Design and implement a Claude Code slash command that generates creative, unique coding interview questions based on the 'vibe' or style requested by the user.

Features to include:
- Accept parameters for difficulty level (easy/medium/hard)
- Support different vibes/themes (e.g., startup, gaming, finance, social media)
- Generate problem statement with clear requirements
- Include example input/output
- Provide hints and follow-up questions
- Suggest optimal time complexity targets

The command should help interviewers create fresh, engaging technical questions that assess coding skills while being memorable and relevant to different contexts.
