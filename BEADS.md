### agentic-tools-fxo: Create /configure-agents command for stage-specific AGENTS.md criteria

**Priority**: P2 | **Type**: feature | **Closed**: 2025-11-11T18:47:41.339893-08:00

Design and implement a Claude Code slash command that adds or updates stage-specific development criteria in AGENTS.md to guide AI coding assistants.

## Context

Currently AGENTS.md provides general guidance for AI agents working in this repo. However, development priorities and quality standards vary significantly by company stage (pre-seed, seed, growth, mature). AI agents need stage-appropriate context to make good architectural and implementation decisions.

## Proposed Solution

Create a `/configure-agents` command that:

1. **Prompts for company stage** (if not already configured)
   - Pre-seed/Stealth
   - Seed/Early
   - Growth
   - Mature

2. **Generates/updates a "Stage-Specific Criteria" section in AGENTS.md** with:
   - Development priorities for this stage
   - Architecture complexity guidelines
   - Quality/testing expectations
   - Performance/scalability considerations
   - Documentation requirements
   - Deployment/infrastructure guidance

3. **Is idempotent**: Can be rerun to update the section when stage changes or criteria evolve

## Implementation Details

- Use the same stage criteria from `claude/production-criteria.md`
- Insert/update a clearly marked section in AGENTS.md (between delimiters or under a specific heading)
- Preserve other content in AGENTS.md
- Support both initial creation and updates

## Example Output

The command should add/update a section like:

```markdown
## Stage-Specific Development Criteria

**Company Stage**: Growth

### Development Priorities
- Ship features quickly while maintaining quality
- Build for scale but avoid premature optimization
- Invest in observability and debugging tools
...

### Architecture Guidelines
- Appropriate abstractions (not too few, not too many)
- Consider multi-tenancy implications
...
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `/configure-agents` command exists
- [ ] Command prompts for stage if not configured
- [ ] Generates appropriate criteria based on stage
- [ ] Updates existing section without breaking other content
- [ ] Criteria align with production-criteria.md
- [ ] Works for all four company stages

### agentic-tools-q8w: Create Claude command for unique vibe coding interview questions

**Priority**: P2 | **Type**: feature | **Closed**: 2025-11-11T18:15:42.62736-08:00

Design and implement a Claude Code slash command that generates creative, unique coding interview questions based on the 'vibe' or style requested by the user.

Features to include:
- Accept parameters for difficulty level (easy/medium/hard)
- Support different vibes/themes (e.g., startup, gaming, finance, social media)
- Generate problem statement with clear requirements
- Include example input/output
- Provide hints and follow-up questions
- Suggest optimal time complexity targets

The command should help interviewers create fresh, engaging technical questions that assess coding skills while being memorable and relevant to different contexts.

### agentic-tools-cqw: Improve BEADS.md output format

**Priority**: P2 | **Type**: task | **Closed**: 2025-11-11T16:18:31.943773-08:00

Enhance the format and presentation of the BEADS.md file generated by ext/beads/generate-beads-summary.sh.

Potential improvements:
- Add color/styling support for terminal output during generation
- Include assignee information in issue listings
- Add created/updated timestamps to issue details
- Show dependency information (blocks/blocked-by relationships)
- Group issues by label or type in addition to status
- Add issue age/staleness indicators
- Include link to full issue details (if applicable)
- Better formatting for multi-line descriptions (code blocks, lists)
- Add table of contents for easy navigation
- Show issue count per status in section headers
- Format dates in human-readable relative time (e.g., '2 days ago')

The goal is to make BEADS.md more informative and easier to scan while maintaining readability for non-technical stakeholders.

### agentic-tools-5oq: Configure pre-commit hook for generate-beads-summary.sh

**Priority**: P2 | **Type**: task | **Closed**: 2025-11-11T16:10:49.9495-08:00

Set up a pre-commit git hook that automatically runs generate-beads-summary.sh to keep BEADS.md in sync with the latest issue status.

The hook should:
- Run bd sync --flush-only to sync the beads database to JSONL
- Execute ext/beads/generate-beads-summary.sh to regenerate BEADS.md
- Stage both .beads/beads.jsonl and BEADS.md files
- Handle errors gracefully and provide helpful output

This ensures BEADS.md is always up-to-date in version control without manual intervention.

Reference: ext/beads/README.md:37-52 has example implementation
