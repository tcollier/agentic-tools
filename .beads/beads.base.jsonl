However, development priorities and quality standards vary significantly by company stage (pre-seed, seed, growth, mature). AI agents need stage-appropriate context to make good architectural and implementation decisions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate a `/configure-agents` command that:\n\n1. **Prompts for company stage** (if not already configured)\n   - Pre-seed/Stealth\n   - Seed/Early\n   - Growth\n   - Mature\n\n2. **Generates/updates a \"Stage-Specific Criteria\" section in AGENTS.md** with:\n   - Development priorities for this stage\n   - Architecture complexity guidelines\n   - Quality/testing expectations\n   - Performance/scalability considerations\n   - Documentation requirements\n   - Deployment/infrastructure guidance\n\n3. **Is idempotent**: Can be rerun to update the section when stage changes or criteria evolve\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Use the same stage criteria from `claude/production-criteria.md`\n- Insert/update a clearly marked section in AGENTS.md (between delimiters or under a specific heading)\n- Preserve other content in AGENTS.md\n- Support both initial creation and updates\n\n## Example Output\n\nThe command should add/update a section like:\n\n```markdown\n## Stage-Specific Development Criteria\n\n**Company Stage**: Growth\n\n### Development Priorities\n- Ship features quickly while maintaining quality\n- Build for scale but avoid premature optimization\n- Invest in observability and debugging tools\n...\n\n### Architecture Guidelines\n- Appropriate abstractions (not too few, not too many)\n- Consider multi-tenancy implications\n...\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `/configure-agents` command exists\n- [ ] Command prompts for stage if not configured\n- [ ] Generates appropriate criteria based on stage\n- [ ] Updates existing section without breaking other content\n- [ ] Criteria align with production-criteria.md\n- [ ] Works for all four company stages","acceptance_criteria":"- Command can be invoked with /configure-agents\n- Stage-specific criteria section is added to AGENTS.md\n- Running command again updates the section in place\n- Criteria match the company stage (pre-seed, seed, growth, mature)\n- Other AGENTS.md content remains intact","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-11T18:25:35.994954-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-11T18:25:35.994954-08:00","source_repo":"."}
